# Sydney's Website

Hi! Thanks for stumbling onto this repo.

Here is my [website](https://sydneyrd-portfolio.netlify.app/)

It contain's information about past and current projects that are being worked on, as well as an about me section.

My inspiration for this website was to create something eclectic, unique, and have a few easter eggs. Because if you noticed...there are 3D elements in my website. The home page logo is able to be zoomed, rotated, and moved, as well as my project names!
